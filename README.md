# date-manipulation-in-python
In this project, we will look at advanced date manipulation with Python. From dates, we will extract weeks, months, quarters, years, and their multiple combinations necessary for our data analysis.

# Description
In this project
* We are dealing with the lightning strikes data of 2016 and 2018.
* First we make a data frame by combining data sets of both the years.
* But before combining, I have filtered some rows out from the 2016 data as a cleaning purpose. These rows had dirty data which caused an error while performing the div() function on strikes count.
* After combing the data sets, we will manipulate the dates to extract weeks, months, quarters, years, and their multiple combinations.
* We will summarize our data on various combinations and make bar chart visualizations.
* Then we will write a function to place data labels on the bars of bar chart.
* Finally, we will extract years and quarters from combination strings to plot an advanced bar chat with the seaborn library.
